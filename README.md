Hi! I'm Rosana. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Iâ€™m a passionate game developer and computer science student with a love for creating fun, interactive experiences. 

My journey in tech combines creativity, problem-solving, and a deep passion for video games - especially Nintendo classics like Mario Kart and ConcernedApe's Stardew Valley, which inspired my career path. ðŸŽ®
